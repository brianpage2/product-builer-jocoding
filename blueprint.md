# Lotto Number Generator

## Overview

A simple, visually appealing web application to generate random lottery numbers.

## Implemented Features

*   **Core Logic:** Generates 6 unique random numbers between 1 and 45.
*   **Basic UI:** Displays the generated numbers in a clean interface with a "Generate" button.
*   **Responsive:** Basic responsive design for both desktop and mobile.

## Current Plan: Visual & Interactive Upgrade

This plan details the steps to transform the basic generator into a visually rich and interactive lottery drawing website.

*   **HTML:**
    *   Link Google Fonts to incorporate more expressive typography.

*   **CSS:**
    *   **Typography:** Use "Black Han Sans" for the main title and "Roboto" for the body text to create a clear visual hierarchy.
    *   **Color Palette:** Introduce a vibrant color scheme. The background will have a subtle noise texture for a premium feel.
    *   **Lottery Balls:** Style the number containers to look like colored lottery balls. Each number range (1-10, 11-20, etc.) will have a distinct color.
    *   **Depth & Effects:** Apply multi-layered drop shadows to the main container and button to create a sense of depth. The button will have a "glow" effect on hover.
    *   **Animation:** Add a fade-in and scale-up animation for the lottery balls when they are generated.

*   **JavaScript:**
    *   Update the logic to dynamically assign the correct color class to each lottery ball based on its number.
